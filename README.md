# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Code Repository

Welcome to my NLP code repository! 

Here's a sample `README.md` file you can use for a repository that contains code related to NLP topics such as N-grams, Bag of Words, and Tokenizers.
This repo serves as a collection of foundational and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and implementations in Python. It is intended for learning, experimenting, and demonstrating core NLP techniques.
You can copy and modify it according to the structure of your project.


## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Bag of Words (BoW)
- Simple BoW implementation from scratch
- Using Scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer`

### 🔹 N-Grams
- Generating n-grams from text
- Bigram/Trigram models
- N-gram Language Modeling basics

### 🔹 Tokenization
- Whitespace-based tokenization
- Tokenization with NLTK, spaCy
- Hugging Face tokenizers (e.g., BERT, GPT)

### 🔹 Stemming and Lemmatization
- Porter, Snowball, and Lancaster stemmers
- Lemmatization with WordNet and spaCy

### 🔹 Stopword Removal
- Custom and standard stopword filters (NLTK, spaCy)

### 🔹 Word Embeddings
- Word2Vec using Gensim
- GloVe embedding loading and usage
